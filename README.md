# Comp Graphic and Visualization

## How do I approach software design?
Working on this project has helped me craft my skills using C++. Most of the work was dealing with classes, vectors, arrays, and pointers. Including libraries, textures, and header files was also something I had not done in a long time.

The design process was a lot of reading documentation for OpenGL and writing pseudocode. Once I had an idea of what I wanted to achieve, I would go to the documents/resources to try to understand how I could implement my ideas/pseudocode.

This process can be applied and many ways in my future work. Planning and thinking about coding efficiency/robustness will always prove to be a useful process.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I do not think I used any new strategies while working on my 3D scene. Much more planning was needed to achieve the result.

Iteration was a huge factor in my development for this project. Taking the development of a 3D scene in steps throughout the weeks was beneficial. I do not think I would have been able to complete this project had I not done it this way. Developing smaller chunks and building off each milestone was very helpful.

My planning evolved throughout the milestones. Each week I would try and start working on the development earlier and earlier. By the end I had a much better grasp on what I needed to complete to finish the project.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Being able to build a standalone project from scratch is a great skill to have and can be applied to my future educational and professional pathway. Understanding C++, or any, data structures can and will be applied in my future professional pathway.
